                <p>As a gift, we thought it would be fun to build you a portfolio website. You can use it however you want, but we imagined you might want to use it to showcase your writing. When the website is completed (to your satisfaction), we'll buy you a domain name as part of the gift, and release the website to the world. It's really mostly just a card right now, but part of the fun would be collaborating to bring it to life. Plus, you could show it off to all of your writer friends!</p>

                <p>Happy Birthday Mom! Your youthful energy, limitless compassion, warmth, and enthusiasm continue to permeate wherever you exist. They are glowing lights in my life and always have been. On your birthday, you deserve the same level of care, effort, and earnest intent that you put in to make any situation special. Whether it's a Friday night dvar, how we practice a certain holiday, a family birthday, or someone returning home from a trip, it's the work that you put in that makes it memorable. Thank you for showing me how to fight my impulse to settle for things being "good enough." At the same time, you've shown us that adults can have fun too. So I hope that on this birthday, we come close to living up to the standard you've demonstrated, and that you have tons of fun, because you deserve to be celebrated. Much love, William. </p>

                <p>Happy Birthday Mommale! I love you so much, and I am so lucky to have you as my mom. You're incredibly cool, with one of the most contagious laughs that I've heard and an amazing self-deprecating sense of humour (check out my Canadaian spelling, eh?). You're super strong both mentally and physically (I dread the 1,000 workout), and in so many ways you're an incredbile role model for all of us. I wish you the happiest of birthdays filled with Wordle, Spider Solitaire, and lots of laughs. 
                    Love,
                    Jared</p>

                <p>Hi momma! Happy Birthday! I'll keep this pretty short. It's been wonderful getting to hang out with you these last few weeks. You are such a great mom. You are so fun, loving, and kind (just to name a  few of your great qualities), and I look forward to having a lot more fun with you this summer. 
                    Love, Joey</p>
